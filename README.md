# Lepus

## What is it?

Lepus is a small tool to match pupils to events/groups according to their
preferences (green, yellow, red).

## Usage

Checkout the code and let your favorite Webserver deliver the `index.html` and
the `assets` directory. That's all.

If you have [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) and
[Task](https://taskfile.dev/) installed, you can use a small server for
development purposes:

    $ task dev-server
